## Answer

Let $R$ be the set of all sets that do not contain themselves.

Paradox.

# Exercise 1.2

Prove that if  $\sim$  is a relation on a set  $S $,

then the corresponding family  $\mathscr{P}_{\sim} $ defined in  $\S 1.5$

is indeed a partition of  $S$  :

that is, its elements are nonempty, disjoint, and their union is  $S$ . [ยง1.5]

---

## Proof

Nonempty: for each class, $x\in\left[x\right]$

Disjoint: Suppose $z\in \left[x\right]\cap\left[y\right]$, then we have:

$z\sim x, z\sim y\Rightarrow x\sim y\Rightarrow \left[x\right] = \left[y\right]$

Union: we can know every element is in some equivalence class.

# Exercise 1.3

Given a partition  $\mathscr{P}$  on a set  $S$ ,

show how to define a relation  $\sim$  on  $S $ such that  

$\mathscr{P}$  is the corresponding partition. [ยง1.5]

---

## Answer

$x\sim y \Leftrightarrow \exists P \in \mathscr{P} s.t. x\in P , y\in P$
