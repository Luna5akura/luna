# Conditional Expectation & Probability 

## Conditional Expectation 

When: $p_Y(y) > 0$

Then: 

$p_{X|Y}(x|y) = p(X=x|Y=y) = \dfrac{p(X=x, Y=y)}{p_Y(y)}$

- $F_{X|Y}(x|y) = P\{X\le x|Y=y\} = \sum_{a\le x}p_{X|Y}(a|y)$
- $E(X|Y=y) = \sum_x xP\{X=x|Y=y\} = \sum_x p_{X|Y} (x|y)$

## Formula 

$Var(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2$

$Var(X) = E[Var(X|Y)] + Var(E[X|Y])$

# Conditional Probability 

## Example

> To maximize the probability of selecting the best award from a sequence of $n$ randomly ordered awards announced one by one (where each rejected award cannot be revisited and accepting an award ends the process)

Solution:

We use the strategy: Pass the first $k$ awards and select the first one that better than before

Denote: $X_k$ as using strategy pass first $k$ awards, $E$ as getting the best award.

If the place we stop (denote as $i$) is the best, we need:

1. The best award is at position $i$
2. The first $i-1$'s awards' best one should be in the first $k$ (Or we will stop in the middle)

Therefore:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
P(E|X_k)\\ 
= \sum_{i=k+1}^n\dfrac{1}{n}\cdot\dfrac{k}{i-1}\\ 
= \dfrac{k}{n}\sum_{i=k+1}^n\dfrac{1}{i-1}\\ 
\approx \dfrac{k}{n}(\ln (n-1) - \ln k)\\ 
\end{array}
$$


To maximize the probability, let 

$f(k) = P(E|X_k) \approx \dfrac{k}{n}(\ln (n-1) - \ln k) $, 

then:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
f'(k) = \dfrac{\ln (n-1) - \ln (ek)}{n}
\end{array}
$$

To maximize probability, we have:

$k = \dfrac{n-1}{e}$
