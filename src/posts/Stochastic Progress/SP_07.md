## Example 1

> A gambler wins 1 unit with probability $ p $ and loses 1 unit with probability $ q=1-p $ in each bet. Assuming each bet is independent and the gambler starts with $ i $ units, what is the probability that their wealth reaches $ N $ before reaching 0 ?

## Example 2 

> Consider a finite-state Markov chain with transient set $ \boldsymbol{T}=\{1,2, \ldots, t\} $. Let
$
\boldsymbol{P}_{\boldsymbol{T}}=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
P_{11} & P_{12} & \cdots & P_{1 t} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
P_{t 1} & P_{t 2} & \cdots & P_{t t}
\end{array}\right]
$
be the submatrix of the transition matrix.

Note: The sum of some rows may be less than 1.
For transient states $ i $ and $ j $, define
$
\begin{aligned}
s_{i j}= & E[\text { number of visits to state } j \text { by a Markov chain starting in state } i] \\
& =E\left[\text { number of times the Markov chain visits state } j \mid X_{0}=i\right]
\end{aligned}
$
which represents the expected number of times the Markov chain, starting from state $ i $, stays in state $ j $. Find $ s_{i j} $.

## Solution 

$ s_{i j}=\delta_{i j}+\sum_{k \in T} P_{i k} \cdot s_{k j} $

Then:

$ \mathbf{S}=\mathbf{I}+\boldsymbol{P}_{\boldsymbol{T}} \cdot \mathbf{S} $

We get:

$ \mathbf{S}=\left(\mathbf{I}-\boldsymbol{P}_{\boldsymbol{T}}\right)^{-1} $

## Final arrive probability

$f_{ij} = \dfrac{s_{ij}-\delta _{ij}}{s_{jj}}$

Proof: $s_{ij} = f_{ij}s_{jj}$

## Example 3 

Consider $ n $ elements $ e_{1}, \ldots, e_{n} $ in an ordered list. At each unit of time, the probability that element $ e_{i} $ is requested is $ P_{i} $, independent of past requests, with $ \sum_{i=1}^{n} P_{i}=1 $. After an element is requested, it is moved to the front of the list.

Objective: Calculate the expected position of the requested element after the system has been running for a long time.

## Solution 

Notice the probability of $e_j$ is before $e_i$ is $\dfrac{P_j}{P_i+P_j}$, then the expectation:

$ E_{i}=1+\sum_{j \neq i} \frac{P_{j}}{P_{i}+P_{j}} $

## Example 4


Let $ X_{i}(i \geq 1)=-1,0,1, \ldots $ be independent and identically distributed random variables. Define $ P_{j}=P\left\{X_{i}=j\right\} $, and assume $ \sum_{j=-1}^{\infty} P_{j}=1 $. Let
$
S_{0}=0, \quad S_{n}=\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_{i}
$

The sequence $ \left\{S_{n}(n \geq 0)\right\} $ represents a random walk with no left jumps (i.e., it can decrease by at most 1).

Question 1: In the long run, what is the total gain? (Assume unlimited borrowing is possible.)

Question 2: Starting with 0 units, on average, after how many bets will a loss of $ k $ units occur?

Question 3: What is the distribution of the number of bets in Question 2?

Question 4: For a prudent gambler, in the long run, how many times does the total gain reach $ -k $ ?

Question 5: For an unlucky gambler, what is the probability that the total gain $ S_{n} $ remains negative?

Question 6: For a regretful gambler, when is the last time they lose exactly $ k $ units?

## Solution 

Question 1: 

$E(X)<0$, it goes to $-\infty$

Question 2:

$E[T_{-1}|X_1] = E[1+ T_{-X_1+1}] = 1+(X_1+1)E[T_{-1}]$

Apply Expectation to both side:

$E[T_{-1}]  = -\dfrac{1}{E[X]}$

Question 3:

$P(T_{-k} = n ) = \dfrac{k}{n}P(S_n = -k)$
- $S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$

Question 4

$E[\sum_{i=1}^\infty I_n] = \sum_{n-1}^\infty P(S_n = -k) = \dfrac {E[T_k]}{k} = -\dfrac{1}{E[X]}$

Question 5

The hitting times $\sim Ge(p)$

$\dfrac{1}{p} = -\dfrac{1}{E[X]}$

Question 6

$$
\begin{array}{l}
E[L_{-k}]\\ 
= \sum_{n=0}^\infty n P(L_{-k} = n) \\ 
= -E[X]\sum_{n=0}^\infty nP(S_n=-k)\\ 
= -E[X]\sum_{n=0}^\infty n \dfrac{n}{k} P(T_{-k}=n) \\ 
= \dfrac{v}{k}\sum_{n=0}^\infty  n^2 P(T_{-k}=n) \\ 
= \dfrac{v}{k}E[T^2_{-k}] \\ 
= \dfrac{v}{k} (E^2[T_{-k}] + Var[T_{-k}])
\end{array}
$$
