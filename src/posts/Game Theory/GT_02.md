# Static 

**Static Games of Complete Information**

Static: make decision simultaneously

Complete information: everyone has the same information 

## Normal form 

Players, strategies, payoffs

- Bi-matrix 
  - 2 players
  - Each has a finite number of strategies 

Example:

$
\begin{array}{c|cc}
 & \text{ (C)} & \text{(D)} \\
\hline
\text{(C)} & (-1, -1) & (-3, 0) \\
\text{(D)} & (0, -3) & (-2, -2) \\
\end{array}
$

## Solving

Dominated strategy
- A strategy **Always** does better regardless of other players' choices

### Iterate

- find Strictly dominated strategy, eliminate it.

Example:


$
\begin{array}{c|ccc}
 & \text{ (Left)} & \text{(Middle)} & \text{(Right)} \\
\hline
\text{(Up)} & (1, 0) & (1, 2) & (0, 1) \\
\text{(Down)} & (0, 3) & (0, 1) & (2, 0) \\
\end{array}
$

Right is dominated by Middle:



$
\begin{array}{c|cc}
 & \text{ (Left)} & \text{(Middle)} \\
\hline
\text{(Up)} & (1, 0) & (1, 2) \\
\text{(Down)} & (0, 3) & (0, 1) \\
\end{array}
$

Down is dominated by Up 



$
\begin{array}{c|cc}
 & \text{ (Left)} & \text{(Middle)} \\
\hline
\text{(Up)} & (1, 0) & (1, 2) \\
\end{array}
$

Left is dominated by Middle 

$
\begin{array}{c|c}
 & \text{(Middle)} \\
\hline
\text{(Up)} & (1, 2) \\
\end{array}
$

## Nash Equilibrium

When in a combination:

- Every player **CANNOT** do better by choosing a different choice.
