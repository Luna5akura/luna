# Long-run property 

## Eventually reaching probability

$f_{i,j} = P(\exists n>0, X_n = j|X_0 = i)$

---

$f_{i,j} = \sum_n f_{ij}^n$
- $f_{i,j}$: Eventually reaching probability
- $f_{ij}$: First reaching probability

## Proposition 

1. if $i $ is recurrent, $i$ and $j $ is transitive, then $f_{i,j} = 1 $

## Positive recurrent & Null recurrent

$N_j = \min \{ n > 0| X_n = j\}$: steps needed for revisit 

$m_j = E[N_j | X_0 = j]$: expectation steps of revisit 

- if $m_j < \infty$, $j$ is **Positive recurrent**
- if $m_j = \infty$, $j$ is **Null recurrent**

---

$m_j = E[N_j|X_0 = j] = \sum_{n=1}^\infty n f_{jj}^{(n)}$
