# Supplier Encroachment with a Dual-Purpose Retailer

# 3 Model and Benchmark

## 3.1 Model Setup

Suppltailerier 
- sell through retailer 

dual-purpose retailer 
- choose order quantity
- maximize profit and consumer surplus

Strategies of retailer:
- Consumer cooperatives
- Certified B Corporation 
- Commercial nonprofit

---
$1$: retailer's weight on profit
$\delta\in[0, 1)$: retailer's weight on consumer surplus 

objective function:

- $v_R=\pi_R+\delta_{CS}$
- $v_S=\pi_S$
  - $\pi$: profit 

$c$: Supplier direct selling cost 

$p=a-bQ$: market clearing price 
- $Q$: total quantity 

$U(Q) = aQ-\dfrac{bQ^2}{2}$" consumer utility function 

$cs = U(Q) - pQ = \dfrac{bQ^2}{2}$: consumer surplus 


(in 5.1: $cs_R = \dfrac{q_R\cdot cs}{q_R+q_S}$)

---

1. Supplier decide encroach ability 
2. supplier decide $w$(whilesale price)
3. retailer decide $q_R$(quantity)
4. supplier decide $q_S$(quantity)

## 3.2 Benchmark Analysis

### 3.2.1 Benchmark Game

for-profit retailer, no encroachment:

$w^N = \dfrac{a}{2}$
$q_R^N = \dfrac{a}{4b}$
$\pi_S^N = \dfrac{a^2}{8b}$
$\pi_R^N = \dfrac{a^2}{16b}$
$cs^N = \dfrac{a^2}{32b}$

### 3.2.2 The Peril of Being a Dual-Purpose Firm

dual-purpose retailer, no encroachment 

$w^{RN} = \dfrac{a}{2}$
$q^{RN }_R = \dfrac{a}{4b-2b\delta}$
$\pi^{RN}_S = \dfrac{a^2}{4b(2-\delta)}$
$\pi^{RN}_R = \dfrac{a^2(1-\delta)}{4b(2-\delta)^2}$

$cs^{RN } = \dfrac{a^2}{8b(2-\delta)^2}$

#### Observation 1 

> In the absence of supplier encroachment, a dual-purpose retailer earns a lower profit than a for-profit retailer.

### 3.2.3  The Bright Side and Downside of Supplier Encroachment. 

for-profit retailer, encroachment 

#### Observation 2 (The Bright Side of Supplier Encroachment)

>  In the benchmark with a for-profit retailer, 
> 
> (i) the supplier is never worse off for having the encroachment ability, and strictly better off for having the option of encroachment when 
> 
> $ c \in[0,5 a / 6) $; 
> 
> (ii) the retailer can be better off by supplier encroachment when 
> 
> $ c \in(3 a /[4 \sqrt{2}],(1-\sqrt{2} / 4) a) $.


#### Observation 3 (The Downside of Supplier Encroachment)

> In the benchmark with a for-profit retailer, 
> 
> both the retailer and consumers can be worse off by supplier encroachment when 
> 
> $ c \in(3 a / 4,5 a / 6) $.

# 4 Results 

dual-purpose encroachment 

## 4.1 Equilibrium

#### (1)

$\pi_{S}=\left(a-b q_{R}-b q_{S}\right) q_{S}-c q_{S}+w q_{R} $

#### (2)

$v_{R}=\left(a-b q_{R}-b q_{S}\right) q_{R}-w q_{R}+\frac{b \delta}{2}\left(q_{R}+q_{S}\right)^{2}$

## 4.2 Encroachment Outcomes under Dual-Purpose Setting

#### Proposition 1

> With a for-profit supplier and a dualpurpose retailer, there exists a threshold on $ \delta $, denoted by $ \delta_{E}=2 \sqrt{2}-2<1 $, such that:
> 
> (i) When $ \delta \in\left[0, \delta_{E}\right] $, 
> 
> - (a) the supplier is better off for having the option of encroachment if $ c \in\left[0, c_{2}(\delta)\right) $, 
> 
> - (b) the supplier is indifferent if $ c \in\left[c_{2}(\delta), a\right) $.
> 
> (ii) When $ \delta \in\left(\delta_{E}, 1\right) $, 
> 
> - (a) the supplier is better off for having the option of encroachment if $ c \in\left[0, c_{3}(\delta)\right) $ or $ c \in\left(c_{4}(\delta), c_{1}(\delta)\right) $ or $ c \in\left(\max \left\{c_{1}(\delta), c_{5}(\delta)\right\}, c_{2}(\delta)\right) $,
> - (b) the supplier is worse off for having the option of encroachment if $ c \in\left(c_{3}(\delta), \min \left\{c_{1}(\delta), c_{4}(\delta)\right\}\right) $ or $ c \in\left(c_{1}(\delta), c_{5}(\delta)\right) $, and
> - (c) the supplier is indifferent if $ c \in\left[c_{2}(\delta), a\right) $.

#### Proposition 2

> With a for-profit supplier and a dualpurpose retailer, there exists a threshold on $ \delta $, denoted by $ \delta_{R}=(34-16 \sqrt{2}) / 23<1 $, such that:
> 
> (i) When $ \delta \in\left[0, \delta_{R}\right] $, the retailer is better off by supplier encroachment if $ c \in\left(c_{6}(\delta), c_{7}(\delta)\right) $, and worse off by supplier encroachment if $ c \in\left[0, c_{6}(\delta)\right) $ or $ c \in\left(c_{7}(\delta), a\right) $.
> 
> (ii) When $ \delta \in\left(\delta_{R}, 1\right) $, the retailer is always worse off by supplier encroachment.

## 4.3 Implication for Firm Profitability 

- Retailer can boost profit from being dual-purpose?

#### Proposition 3

> In the presence of supplier encroachment, a dual-purpose retailer earns a higher profit than a for-profit retailer when:
> 
> (i) $ c \in\left(c_{3}(\delta), \min \left\{(3 a \sqrt{2-2 \delta}) /(8-4 \delta), c_{4}(\delta)\right\}\right) $; or 
> 
> (ii) $ c \in\left(\max \left\{a-a \sqrt{2-2 \delta} /(4-2 \delta), c_{2}(\delta)\right\}, 5 a / 6\right) $.

## 4.4 Implications for Consumer Surplus

#### Proposition 4

> Consumer surplus when the retailer is a dual-purpose corporation compared to when he is a purely for-profit firm:
> 
> (i) is lower if $ c \in\left(c_{3}(\delta), \min \left\{(3 a-3 a \delta) /(2-\delta), c_{4}(\delta)\right\}\right) $;
> 
> (ii) is indifferent if $ c \in\left(3 a / 5, c_{2}(\delta)\right) $;
> 
> (iii) is higher if $ c $ is not within the region specified above.

#### Proposition 5

> Retailer's interest in consumer surplus
> 
> (i) increases his own profit but reduces consumer surplus if $ c \in\left(c_{3}(\delta), \min \{(3 a \sqrt{2-2 \delta}) /(8-4 \delta),(3 a-3 a \delta) /\right. $ $ \left.\left.(2-\delta), c_{4}(\delta)\right\}\right) $;
> 
> (ii) increases both his own profit and consumer surplus if $ \quad(a) \quad c \in\left(\max \left\{c_{3}(\delta),(3 a-3 a \delta) /(2-\delta)\right\},(3 a\right. $ $ \sqrt{2-2 \delta}) /(8-4 \delta)) ; $ or (b) $ c \in(\max \{a-a \sqrt{2-2 \delta} / $ $ \left.\left.(4-2 \delta), c_{2}(\delta)\right\}, 5 a / 6\right) $.

# 5 Extensions 

## 5.1 Consumer Surplus Specific to the Retailer’s Quantity

retailer only care his consumers' surplus

$cs_R = \dfrac{q_R\cdot cs}{q_R+q_S}$

#### Proposition 6

> Under the parsimonious dual-purpose retailer setting, 
> 
> (i) the supplier is always better off for having the encroachment ability; 
> 
> (ii) the retailer is better off by supplier encroachment if $ c \in\left(\bar{c}_{3}(\delta), \bar{c}_{4}(\delta)\right) $.

#### Proposition 7

> (i) The retailer earns a higher profit from establishing himself as a parsimonious dual-purpose firm rather than a pure profit maximizer if: 
> 
> - (a) $ c \in\left(\bar{c}_{5}(\delta), \bar{c}_{6}(\delta)\right) $; or $ 
> - (b) c \in\left(\max \left\{\bar{c}_{2}(\delta), \bar{c}_{7}(\delta)\right\}, 5 a / 6\right) $. 
> 
> (ii) The presence of parsimonious dual-purpose retailer has no effect on consumer surplus if $ c \in\left(3 a / 5, \bar{c}_{2}(\delta)\right) $; Otherwise, it always increases consumer surplus.

## 5.2 Extremely High Interests in Consumer Surplus

$\delta\in[1,2)$

#### Proposition 8

> When $ \delta \in[1,2) $,
> 
>  (i) the supplier is worse off for having the option to encroach if $ c \in\left(0, \tilde{c}_{2}(\delta)\right) $; 
> 
> (ii) the retailer's profit is always worse off by supplier encroachment; 
> 
> (iii) the dual-purpose structure always hurts the retailer's profit but benefits consumer surplus.

## 5.3 Price Competition


$k$: differentiation 

$q_i = \dfrac{(1-k)a-p_i+kp_i}{1-k^2}$

- tension between supplier encroachment and the retailer’s dual-purpose structure becomes less intense

- the encroachment deterrence effect (i.e., deterring the supplier from selling a positive quantity) is not present with a dual-purpose retailer

- the reduction in wholesale price is less pronounced than under quantity competition

- the supplier will sell a positive quantity through her direct channel in a smaller region of parameter space

- the supplier secures greater retail profit (relies more on reselling) by raising the wholesale price even if her selling cost is relatively small
